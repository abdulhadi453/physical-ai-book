## Answer Key and Scoring

### Section 1 Answers:
1. b) Physical AI operates directly in physical environments with perception-action loops
2. d) Virtual reality displays
3. False - some systems might be purely sensing or actuating
4. Sample answer: Embodiment shapes intelligence by constraining and enabling interactions with the environment. The physical form affects what the system can perceive and how it can act, fundamentally influencing cognitive processes.
5. b) Physical form fundamentally shapes interactions and capabilities

### Section 2 Answers:
6. b) Perception, Reasoning, Action
7. b) It enables adaptation to environmental changes
8. b) It adjusts its behavior based on the feedback
9. Sample answer: Autonomous vacuum cleaner - Perceives dirt and obstacles via sensors, reasons about optimal cleaning path, and acts by moving and cleaning.
10. True

### Section 3 Answers:
11. c) Both rotation and translation
12. b) Calculating end-effector position from joint angles
13. b) They provide reference frames for spatial reasoning
14. With both joints at 90°: x = L1*cos(90°) + L2*cos(90°+90°) = 0 + 3*cos(180°) = 0 + 3*(-1) = -3; y = L1*sin(90°) + L2*sin(90°+90°) = 5*1 + 3*sin(180°) = 5 + 0 = 5. So position is (-3, 5).
15. Sample answer: Mathematical models provide precise representations of system behavior, enabling accurate control, prediction, and optimization of Physical AI systems.

### Section 4 Answers:
16. b) Physical properties can perform computations that would otherwise require algorithms
17. b) Possibilities for action offered by environment-body coupling
18. b) Rough terrain navigation
19. Sample answer should include task description, appropriate embodiment, perception-action components, and mathematical applications.
20. Sample answer should include metrics like task completion rate, efficiency, safety, adaptability, etc.
