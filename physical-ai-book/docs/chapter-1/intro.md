# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the fascinating world of Physical AI! This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental concepts that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and the physical world.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you will:
- Understand the core principles of Physical AI
- Explore how AI systems interact with the physical world
- Learn about sensors, actuators, and control systems
- Build your first simple Physical AI project

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with mathematical concepts (algebra and basic calculus)
- Access to a computer with internet connection

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is divided into three lessons:
1. **Lesson 1**: Foundations of Physical AI - Core concepts and theory
2. **Lesson 2**: Sensors and Perception - How AI systems sense the world
3. **Lesson 3**: Actuators and Control - How AI systems act on the world

Each lesson follows the 8-component structure designed to maximize your learning experience through a combination of theory, practice, and reflection.
