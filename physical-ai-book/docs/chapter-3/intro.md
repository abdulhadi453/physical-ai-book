# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on creating intelligent decision-making systems for robots using the NVIDIA Isaac platform. Here, you'll learn how to build AI agents that can perceive, reason, and act in physical environments, forming what we call the "AI-Robot Brain."

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Design and implement AI agents using NVIDIA Isaac platform that can process multimodal sensor data
- Integrate vision-language-action systems with robotic platforms for complex task execution
- Apply machine learning models within NVIDIA Isaac for perception and decision-making
- Create intelligent control systems that demonstrate embodied intelligence principles
- Deploy AI-robotic systems on NVIDIA Isaac simulation and target platforms
- Evaluate and optimize AI-robot performance using NVIDIA Isaac tools

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:

- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: Simulation and Control Systems
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with robotics concepts and simulation environments

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main lessons:

1. **Lesson 1**: NVIDIA Isaac Simulation Environment and ROS Integration
2. **Lesson 2**: Navigation and Path Planning with Nav2
3. **Lesson 3**: Perception and AI Decision Making

Each lesson includes theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and assessments to validate your understanding.
