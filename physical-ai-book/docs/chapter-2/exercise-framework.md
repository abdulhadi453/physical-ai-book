# Simulation Exercise Framework

## Overview
This framework provides the structure and guidelines for implementing simulation exercises throughout this module. Each exercise follows a consistent format designed to maximize learning outcomes and ensure measurable progress.

## Exercise Structure

### 1. Learning Objectives
Each exercise begins with clear, measurable learning objectives that define what students will be able to do upon completion.

### 2. Prerequisites
A list of required knowledge or skills needed before starting the exercise.

### 3. Exercise Steps
Detailed, step-by-step instructions that guide students through the exercise.

### 4. Expected Outcomes
Clear descriptions of what successful completion looks like.

### 5. Assessment Questions
Questions that test understanding and application of the concepts covered.

### 6. Advanced Challenges
Optional extensions for students who want to deepen their knowledge.

### 7. Resources
Relevant documentation, tutorials, and references for further learning.

## Exercise Types

### Physics Simulation Exercises
Focus on environment creation, physics parameters, and object interactions.

### Sensor Simulation Exercises
Focus on implementing and testing various sensor types (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs).

### Integration Exercises
Combine physics and sensor simulation in complex scenarios.

### Cross-Platform Exercises
Compare and validate results across different simulation platforms.

## Assessment Framework

### Performance Metrics
- Completion time
- Accuracy of implementation
- Quality of results
- Understanding demonstrated through assessment questions

### Validation Criteria
- Does the simulation behave as expected?
- Are the results consistent with theoretical predictions?
- Can the student explain the underlying principles?

## Progress Tracking
Students can track their progress through:
- Exercise completion status
- Assessment scores
- Skill mastery indicators
- Time spent on each exercise

## Best Practices

### For Students
- Follow the step-by-step instructions carefully
- Take notes on your observations
- Ask questions when concepts are unclear
- Experiment with variations after completing the core exercise

### For Educators
- Customize exercises for your specific learning objectives
- Provide timely feedback on assessments
- Encourage exploration beyond the basic requirements
- Use the framework consistently across all exercises

## Next Steps
This framework will be applied to all exercises in this module, starting with Exercise 1: Basic Environment Creation.
