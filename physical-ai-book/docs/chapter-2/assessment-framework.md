# Assessment and Evaluation Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating student progress and understanding throughout the Digital Twin simulation module. The assessment strategy combines formative and summative evaluations to ensure students achieve the learning objectives.

## Assessment Types

### 1. Formative Assessments
- **Purpose**: Ongoing evaluation during learning activities
- **Format**: Exercise completion, peer reviews, self-assessment
- **Timing**: Throughout each exercise and lesson
- **Focus**: Understanding progress and identifying areas for improvement

### 2. Summative Assessments
- **Purpose**: Final evaluation of learning outcomes
- **Format**: Module completion exercises, comprehensive projects
- **Timing**: End of each major section
- **Focus**: Mastery of key concepts and skills

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Competency
- Ability to create and configure simulation environments
- Understanding of physics parameters and their effects
- Proficiency in sensor simulation and integration
- Cross-platform consistency validation

### Problem-Solving Skills
