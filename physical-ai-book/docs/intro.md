# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - an interactive learning platform designed to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and embodied systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with real-world physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must navigate, interact with, and adapt to the complexities of the physical world. This includes robots that perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute actions in real-time.

## About This Textbook

This AI-native textbook is specifically designed for the competitive hackathon focused on creating AI-enhanced educational materials. The content integrates:

- **Robotics Simulation**: Using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac platforms
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Understanding how AI systems interact with physical environments
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Building robots that can see, understand, and act
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Advanced systems that mimic human-like movement and interaction

## Learning Approach

This textbook takes a simulation-first approach, allowing you to experiment with complex robotics concepts in safe, reproducible environments before considering real hardware deployment. Each concept is accompanied by:

- Interactive examples and code snippets
- Simulation exercises you can run immediately
- AI-enhanced explanations and tutoring
- Real-world applications and case studies

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

1. Ensure you have the required prerequisites (Python, ROS 2, simulation environments)
2. Follow the setup guide in Chapter 1
3. Work through the progressive lessons that build from fundamentals to advanced concepts
4. Engage with the AI tutoring system for personalized assistance

The content is structured to take you from basic robotics concepts to advanced humanoid systems, with each chapter building on the previous knowledge while maintaining accessibility for learners with computer science and AI backgrounds.
