# Implementation Plan: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

**Branch**: `001-vla` | **Date**: 2025-12-17 | **Spec**: [specs/001-vla/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-vla/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Module 4 implements Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that enable humanoid robots to understand and execute natural language commands through an integrated pipeline. The system accepts voice input via Whisper speech-to-text, processes commands with LLM-based cognitive planning, integrates visual perception for object identification, and executes actions through ROS 2 action servers. This creates an end-to-end system that demonstrates the integration of vision, language, and action for embodied AI systems.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, C++ (ROS 2 packages), JavaScript/TypeScript (Docusaurus)
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill), NVIDIA Isaac Sim, OpenAI Whisper, Large Language Models (OpenAI/Anthropic), OpenCV, PyTorch
**Storage**: N/A (simulation-based learning module with configuration files)
**Testing**: pytest for Python components, ROS 2 testing framework, simulation validation tests
**Target Platform**: Linux/Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (ROS 2 requirement), NVIDIA Isaac Sim compatible GPU
**Project Type**: Documentation/educational module with simulation components
**Performance Goals**: <5 second response time from voice input to action execution, 85% accuracy for basic tasks, 80% success rate for complex multi-step commands
**Constraints**: Simulation-first approach using NVIDIA Isaac, modular architecture for component testing, reproducible setup across development environments, integration with existing Docusaurus textbook

**Structure Decision**: The module follows the established Docusaurus textbook pattern with educational content in the docs/chapter-4/ directory, while simulation components are added to support the hands-on learning experience. This maintains consistency with previous modules (1-3) while enabling the VLA functionality.
