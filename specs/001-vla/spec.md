## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Voice Command Processing (Priority: P1)

As a robotics researcher or educator, I want to speak natural language commands to a humanoid robot so that it can understand and execute complex tasks through a vision-language-action pipeline. This includes the robot hearing the command, converting speech to text, processing the text with an LLM for cognitive planning, and executing actions via ROS 2.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables the entire VLA system to function. Without voice processing, the core value proposition of the module cannot be delivered.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by giving a simple voice command like "Move the red block to the left" and observing that the robot processes the speech, identifies the object, and executes the appropriate movement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a humanoid robot with VLA system active and microphone operational, **When** a user speaks a clear command like "Pick up the blue cube", **Then** the system converts speech to text, processes the intent, identifies the object, and executes the grasping action via ROS 2.

2. **Given** a robot in a simulated environment with known objects, **When** a user speaks a navigation command like "Go to the kitchen", **Then** the system processes the command and executes navigation via ROS 2 action servers.

### User Story 2 - Multi-Modal Perception Integration (Priority: P2)

As a robotics student, I want the VLA system to integrate visual perception with language understanding so that I can give commands that reference objects in the robot's field of view, enabling complex manipulation tasks that require both vision and language processing.

**Why this priority**: This builds upon the core voice processing capability to enable more sophisticated interactions that demonstrate the true power of vision-language integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by placing multiple objects in the robot's view and commanding it to "Pick up the object to the left of the red cube", verifying that vision and language processing work together.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple objects in the robot's visual field, **When** a user gives a relative positioning command like "Move the object near the blue box to the table", **Then** the system identifies the correct object through visual analysis and executes the manipulation task.

---

### User Story 3 - Cognitive Planning and Task Execution (Priority: P3)

As an AI researcher, I want the VLA system to use LLM-based cognitive planning to break down complex commands into sequences of executable actions so that humanoid robots can perform multi-step tasks requiring reasoning and planning.

**Why this priority**: This represents the advanced AI capabilities that make the VLA system valuable beyond simple command-response interactions, enabling complex autonomous behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by giving a complex multi-step command like "Go to the kitchen, find a cup, bring it to the table", and verifying that the system plans and executes the sequence of actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complex multi-step command, **When** the LLM processes the request, **Then** it generates a sequence of executable ROS 2 actions that accomplish the overall goal.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the speech recognition system receives ambiguous commands like "That thing over there" without clear visual references?
- How does the system handle commands that reference objects not visible to the robot's cameras?
- What happens when the LLM generates an action sequence that is physically impossible for the robot to execute?
- How does the system handle noisy environments where speech recognition might fail?
- What occurs when the robot encounters obstacles not accounted for in the cognitive plan?
