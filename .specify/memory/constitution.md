# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Vision
To empower beginners and intermediate learners with hands-on knowledge and practical skills in Physical AI, making complex concepts accessible and engaging through interactive documentation.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-on Learning First
Prioritize practical exercises and real-world projects. Every concept introduced must be accompanied by an actionable example or experiment that readers can replicate.

### II. Clarity and Accessibility
Explain complex Physical AI concepts in a clear, beginner-friendly manner, avoiding jargon where possible or thoroughly explaining it when necessary. The content must be accessible to a broad audience, from beginners to intermediate learners.

### III. Modular Progression
Structure content for gradual learning, building from fundamental to advanced topics. Each module should be self-contained but contribute to a cohesive understanding of Physical AI.

### IV. Community and Collaboration
Encourage contributions from the community (feedback, examples, corrections) and foster a supportive learning environment. The Docusaurus platform should facilitate easy collaboration.

### V. Practical Application
Focus on tangible applications and real-world relevance of Physical AI. Demonstrate how theoretical concepts translate into practical systems and solutions.

## Success Criteria
- High user engagement and retention on the Docusaurus platform.
- Positive feedback and testimonials from the target audience (beginners to intermediate).
- Measurable increase in users' understanding and ability to apply Physical AI concepts (e.g., through project completion rates).
- Active community contributions to the documentation, including new examples, corrections, and translations.

## Constraints
- **Target Audience**: Content must cater to beginners to intermediate learners.
- **Technology Stack**: Documentation strictly uses Docusaurus.
- **Learning Focus**: Primary emphasis is on hands-on learning and practical application.
- **Scope**: Primarily covers introductory to intermediate Physical AI concepts; advanced research topics are out of scope.
- **Resource Limitations**: Development and content creation adhere to available team resources and timelines.

## Stakeholders
- **Learners**: The primary audience (beginners to intermediate) seeking to understand and apply Physical AI.
- **Content Creators/Authors**: Individuals responsible for developing and maintaining the book's content.
- **Contributors**: Community members who provide feedback, corrections, new content, and examples.
- **Project Maintainers**: Individuals overseeing the Docusaurus platform, infrastructure, and overall project health.

## Brand Voice
- **Empowering**: Inspiring confidence and capability in learners to tackle Physical AI challenges.
- **Approachable**: Friendly, clear, and non-intimidating, making complex topics less daunting.
- **Practical**: Focused on actionable insights, real-world relevance, and hands-on experience.
- **Supportive**: Encouraging and guiding users through learning challenges with empathy.
- **Curious**: Fostering exploration, critical thinking, and a desire to learn more about Physical AI.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require documentation, team consensus, and a clear migration plan. All content contributions and platform changes must verify compliance with these principles.
